# Combining Imitation and Reinforcement Learning to Surpass Human Performance
This repository was used for the work in my dissertation project for Newcastle University.

Some files in this code were created using the code from the paper Evans et al., "Comparing deep reinforcement learning architectures for autonomous racing" that is available on GitHub [https://github.com/BDEvan5/f1tenth_drl.git] and from the official F1TENTH repository f1tenth_gym [https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym.git].
